# GBV
Gender-based violence is of critical concern in Africa today, with survivors failing to report
reports because of fear, stigmatization, and lack of reporting systems. Government helplines,
NGOs service, and others tend to resolve the issues ineffectually; this is because of poor
responses, lack of anonymity, and limited accessibility. Most of the platforms presently in use
allow only reporting or support services, while very few manage to bring them together safely
and user-friendlily.

THE UNIQUENESS OF SOLUTION IS AS FOLLOW:
- ENCRYPTION: There is end-to-end encryption; this will ensure an assured sense of security on
the part of the GBV survivors so that they may report their cases without fear of either
retaliation or data theft.
- AI CASE PRIORITIZATION: Artificial intelligence will provide a real-time case prioritization service
that will first make an assessment of whose case is more urgent so that this data may be passed
to the proper authorities or support organizations.
- MULTI-CHANNEL REPORTING: All users across various platforms (Mobile app, Web) will
have the opportunity to report so as to cater to those in areas where access and time are
limited.
- INTEGRATED SUPPORT SERVICES: This will provide direct access to legal aid, shelter, and
counseling, hence closing the gap between reporting the case and receiving help.
